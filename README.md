### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone project
git clone [project URL]

# Install main app dependencies
npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

Node.js environment configuration for packaging:
   - Download Node.js runtime for your platform
   - Root directory configuration:
     - Windows: Name Node.js environment folder as `node_win32`
     - macOS: Name Node.js environment folder as `node_darwin`
     - Linux: Name Node.js environment folder as `node_linux`
   - Server directory configuration:
     - Copy Node.js environment corresponding to current system to `server` directory, named uniformly as `node`
     - Example: On Windows, copy `node_win32` to `server/node`

```bash
# Start development environment
npm run dev

# Start on Windows
npm run dev:win

# Build application
npm run build
```

Directory structure example:
   ```
   Project Root/
   ├── node_win32/     # Windows Node.js environment
   ├── node_darwin/    # macOS Node.js environment
   ├── node_linux/     # Linux Node.js environment
   └── server/
       └── node/       # Current system Node.js environment (for debugging)
   ```
